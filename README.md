# 🚀 Packer Unpacker - Java File Archiving Utility (CUI Based).

**Packer Unpacker** is a Java-based Command Line Interface (CUI) application developed by **Dnyanesh More** that simulates a basic file archiving system. It allows users to **pack multiple files** into a single custom archive file and later **unpack** them back to their original state.

This project demonstrates **manual byte-level file handling**, **header-based metadata management**, and **Java I/O** operations — mimicking core features of real-world tools like ZIP or TAR with a custom implementation.
